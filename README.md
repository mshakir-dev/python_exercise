### Python Exercise
Python is a popular programming language. It is used for web development (server-side), software development, mathematics,
system scripting.

## What can Python do?
1. Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
2. Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
### What can Python do?
1. Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
2. Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
3. Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
4. Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
5. Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

### Creating Variables
Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.
### Variable Names
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

### Python Operators
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
Python divides the operators in the following groups:
1. Arithmetic operators
2. Assignment operators
3. Comparison operators
4. Logical operators
5. Identity operators
6. Membership operators
7. Bitwise operators
8. And Operation:
Returns True if both statements are true
9. Or Operation:
Returns True if one of the statements is true
10. Not Operator
Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true
11. Python Identity Operators
Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location
12. Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:

Python Collections (Arrays)
There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:
### List 
List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
### Tuple
Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
### Set 
Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
Dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members.
